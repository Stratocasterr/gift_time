### Account types

In my system, there are three different account types to choose from:

#### Child

Child can write messages to Santa to ask about dream gift and receive messages from santa and notifications about his/her gift delivery status.

### Santa

Santa receives messages from children  about their dream presents. After making up his decision, he can delete message and all gift list if kid was rude or edit this list by adding new presents or replacing presents with these more suitable. After this, he send message with new presents list to his helpers - Elfs. Ofcourse, everybody knows ( I hope), that there can be only one Santa type account!

### Elf

Elf is a Santa's best helper. His main task is to prepare gifts after receiving list from Santa. After that, he can mark given order as ' ready to send '. What is more, he can also write message to Santa if there are some questions/ doubts about gifts.
